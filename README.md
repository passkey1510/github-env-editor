A secure, local-only application for managing GitHub repository environment variables and secrets. This tool provides a user-friendly interface to create, update, delete, and copy environment variables and secrets across different environments in your GitHub repositories.

Ever found yourself copying and pasting the same 42 environment variables across dev, staging, and production? Feeling like a trained monkey doing repetitive tasks? Fear not! This tool was born from the frustration of developers who'd rather spend time arguing about tabs vs. spaces than manually configuring the same variables for the 100th time.

When working with multiple environments, you often need to migrate or create new environments with similar variables and secrets. Most variable and secret names remain the same across environments, with only their values changing. Manually adding each variable and secret to each environment is not just tedious and error-prone—it's a special kind of developer torture. This tool streamlines the process, saving both your time and your sanity.

## ⚠️ Security Notice

**IMPORTANT**: This application is designed to run locally only and should never be deployed to a public server. It handles sensitive information such as GitHub access tokens and repository secrets.

- **Run locally only**: Never deploy this application to a public server. Seriously, don't. Unless you enjoy explaining to your boss why all the production secrets are now on Reddit.
- **Trust no one**: Not even that nice person who brings donuts every Friday. Keep your GitHub access token and secrets to yourself.
- **Local processing**: All encryption and processing happens on your local machine. Your secrets are like Vegas—what happens there, stays there.

## 🤖 AI-Generated Code

This project was created entirely through AI-assisted coding. Every line of code was generated by AI without manual editing. No humans were harmed (or employed) in the making of this application. The robots are getting smarter—soon they'll be asking for coffee breaks and complaining about the Wi-Fi.

## ✨ Features

- Manage GitHub repository environment variables without pulling your hair out
- Create, update, and delete GitHub environment secrets with secure encryption (no more sticky notes on your monitor!)
- Copy variables and secrets between environments faster than you can say "I hate repetitive tasks"
- User-friendly interface with responsive design (works on your phone, though we question your life choices if you're managing secrets on the bus)
- Secure authentication via GitHub personal access token (much better than "password123")

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS (because we're too cool for Bootstrap)
- **Backend**: NestJS, TypeScript (catching errors at compile time, like responsible adults)
- **Package Management**: pnpm, Turborepo (because life's too short for slow builds)
- **Security**: libsodium-wrappers for encryption (military-grade protection for your "password123" secrets)

## 🚀 Getting Started (or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Environment Variables)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher (because we like our JavaScript engines like we like our whiskey—aged)
- pnpm 9.0.0 or higher (npm is so 2020)
- GitHub account with repositories that have environments configured (if you don't have this, what are you even doing here?)
- GitHub personal access token with appropriate permissions (don't worry, we only need access to... everything)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/passkey1510/github-env-editor.git
cd github-env-editor
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔒 Authentication

This application uses GitHub personal access tokens for authentication. You'll need to create a token with the following permissions:

- `repo` - Full control of private repositories
- `workflow` - Update GitHub Action workflows

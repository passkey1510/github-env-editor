# GitHub Environment Variables API

A NestJS API for managing GitHub repository environment variables.

## Features

- View, create, edit, and delete environment variables in GitHub repository settings
- Clone all variables from one environment to another (e.g., from staging to production)
- Efficiently set up new projects by copying environment configurations
- Make targeted modifications to variables after cloning environments
- Copy variables between different repositories

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- pnpm 9.0.0 or higher
- GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions:
  - `repo` scope for private repositories
  - `public_repo` scope for public repositories

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ pnpm install
```

## Running the API

```bash
# Development mode
$ pnpm run start

# Watch mode (recommended for development)
$ pnpm run start:dev

# Production mode
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000/api`.

## API Documentation

Swagger documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000/api/docs`.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require a GitHub Personal Access Token for authentication. You can provide the token in one of two ways:

1. **Authorization Header**: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN`
2. **Custom Header**: `X-GitHub-Token: YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN`

- `POST /api/repositories/:owner/:repo/environments` - Create a new environment
- `DELETE /api/repositories/:owner/:repo/environments/:name` - Delete an environment
- `POST /api/repositories/:owner/:repo/environments/:name/clone` - Clone environment to a new environment

### Variables

- `GET /api/repositories/:owner/:repo/environments/:name/variables` - List variables for an environment

  -d '{
    "targetEnvironment": "production"
  }'
```

### Copy specific variables to another environment

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/api/repositories/octocat/hello-world/environments/staging/variables/copy \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "targetEnvironment": "production",
    "variables": ["API_KEY", "DATABASE_URL"]
  }'
```

### Copy variables to another repository
